.TH NOSLEEP 1 "Sep 20, 2011" "" "CYGWIN"


.SH NAME
nosleep - Run a program while inhibiting computer sleep or hibernation


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nosleep
[--awaymode|--powerplan]
.I command
.RI [ args ]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nosleep
runs the supplied command,
.I command 
.RI [ args ],
while inhibiting the computer from sleeping or hibernating until the command
finishes executing.

.B nosleep
does not guarantee that the computer won't go to sleep.  By default, it just
prevents the computer from automatically putting itself to sleep during periods
of no user input (although it still allows the display to turn off).  If the
user closes the laptop lid or presses the power button, the computer will still
behave as its power management plan dictates--typically by going to sleep,
hibernating, or shutting down.

Inhibiting idle sleep is a safe mode of operation, since it won't prevent the
computer from shutting down if needs to to conserve power, and for many
applications this mode is sufficient.  When it's not, options are available,
below, to more aggressively inhibit sleep or hibernation.  But before you use
any of them, you must read the:


.SH WARNINGS AND DISCLAIMER
Aggressively inhibiting sleep or hibernation carries at least the following
disadvantages and risks:

.TP
1.
If the host is running on battery, preventing sleep or hibernation could
cause it to run out of power and shut down uncleanly, potentially causing
data loss.

.TP
2.
Users may become confused or frustrated if the usual sleep behavior that they
expect, such as going to sleep when the laptop lid is closed, stops working or
only works some of the time.

.TP
3.
.B nosleep
still can't guarantee that the
.I command
will complete, since it can't prevent users or other processes from shutting
down the host.  For example, a user who tries and fails to put the computer to sleep may decide to shut it down instead.

.LP
The author disclaims all responsibility for any losses you may incur by using
the more aggressive options below.


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
--awaymode
Make the computer go into "away mode" when it would normally go to sleep.
The computer will appear to be asleep, but the
.I command
will continue executing.  The Windows documentation[1] says: "Applications that
do not require critical background processing or that run on portable computers
should not enable away mode because it prevents the system from conserving power
by entering true sleep."  Use your power for good, not evil.

On Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP/2000, away mode is not supported and this
option will have no effect.

.TP
--powerplan
Activate a temporary power management plan that prevents sleep and
hibernation, even under typical events such as closing the laptop lid or
pressing the power button.  The original power plan will be restored when the
.I command
finishes executing.  This is the most aggressive option.  In addition to the
warnings above, this option carries the additional risk that the temporary power
scheme will be left in place if
.B nosleep
is killed before
.I command
completes, for example if the power is interrupted (battery ran out?).

The --powerplan option may fail if you don't have sufficient administrative
privileges.  In that case
.B nosleep
will emit an error message but continue running in its default mode.

.SH EXAMPLE
.IP
nosleep rsync dir1 dir2
.LP
will run rsync to synchronize dir1 and dir2, inhibiting computer sleep until
rsync exits.
